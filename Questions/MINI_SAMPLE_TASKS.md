## Task 1: STEM-Technical

**Meta-cluster covers:** Computing, Engineering, Maths

**What it measures:** Systems thinking, reasoning from effect to cause, elimination logic

**Format:** MCQ

**Task:**

> A student builds an automatic plant watering system:
> - Moisture sensor checks soil every hour
> - If soil is dry, pump activates for 10 seconds
> - Pump draws water from tank
> - Tank has a float sensor that shows empty/not empty
> - If tank is empty, warning light turns on and pump won't activate
>
> Problem: The soil is dry, the tank is full, but the pump never activates. The warning light is off.
>
> Which component is most likely faulty?
>
> A) Moisture sensor
> B) Pump
> C) Float sensor
> D) Warning light

**Answer:** A

**Reasoning:**
- Warning light off + tank full = float sensor working, tank not empty
- Pump never activates = either not receiving signal or broken
- If pump was broken, system would still try to activate it
- If moisture sensor reads "wet" incorrectly, pump never gets triggered
- This explains all symptoms

**Common errors:**
- B (assumes pump is broken, but doesn't explain why system isn't trying)
- C (float sensor is working, warning light would be on if it wasn't)

## Task 2: STEM-Scientific

**Meta-cluster covers:** Physical Sciences, Life Sciences

**What it measures:** Scientific curiosity, handling anomalies, investigation mindset vs procedural compliance

**Format:** MCQ

**Task:**

> You're growing bacteria for a lab project. You've set up three identical petri dishes with the same bacteria and nutrients.
>
> After 48 hours, two dishes have normal growth. The third has almost no growth, but you notice a small patch of mould in the corner.
>
> What's your next step?
>
> A) Discard the third dish and report results from the two successful ones
> B) Repeat the entire experiment. Something went wrong.
> C) Investigate the mould. It might be producing something that kills bacteria.
> D) Report all three dishes and note the anomaly for the supervisor

**Answer:** C (D also defensible)

**Reasoning:**
- This mirrors the penicillin discovery story
- A and B treat the anomaly as a problem to eliminate
- C shows scientific curiosity and pattern recognition
- D is cautious but still engages with the anomaly rather than discarding it

**What answers reveal:**
- A = procedural, wants clean data
- B = perfectionist, restarts rather than investigates
- C = curious, sees anomalies as signals
- D = cautious but engaged, defers to authority

## Task 3: Humanities

**Meta-cluster covers:** History, Languages, Philosophy, English

**What it measures:** Identifying assumptions in arguments, logical structure, counterfactual thinking

**Format:** MCQ

**Task:**

> A historian writes:
>
> "The factory workers of 1830s Manchester lived in appalling conditions. Contemporary accounts describe overcrowded housing, poor sanitation, and widespread disease. This proves that industrialisation was a disaster for the working class."
>
> A tutor asks: "What's the problem with this argument?"
>
> A) The sources might be biased. Reformers had reasons to exaggerate.
> B) "Appalling" is subjective. Conditions might have been normal for the time.
> C) It only describes Manchester. Other industrial cities might have been different.
> D) It doesn't compare to conditions before industrialisation. Workers might have been worse off in rural areas.

**Answer:** D

**Reasoning:**
- The argument claims industrialisation was a "disaster"
- But it only shows conditions were bad, not that they were worse than before
- You can't call something a disaster without a comparison point
- A, B, and C are valid concerns but D identifies the core logical flaw

**Common errors:**
- A (valid but not the central flaw)
- B (true but misses the comparison issue)
- C (scope issue, but doesn't address the core logic)

## Task 4: Social Sciences

**Meta-cluster covers:** Psychology, Sociology, Politics, Economics

**What it measures:** Understanding self-selection, distinguishing behaviour from motivation, scepticism of surface explanations

**Format:** Short response

**Task:**

> Research shows that employees who work from home report higher job satisfaction. A company mandates work-from-home for all staff to improve morale.
>
> In one sentence, why might this backfire?
>
> [Text box]

**AI grading criteria:**

| Score | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| 0 | No reasoning or misses the point |
| 1 | Vague ("not everyone likes working from home") |
| 2 | Identifies self-selection (people who chose it liked it, forcing is different) |
| 3 | Explains self-selection AND considers who loses out (extroverts, new staff, those with poor home setups) |

**Example answers by score:**

**Score 0:**
> "It won't backfire, working from home is good."

**Score 1:**
> "Some people might not like working from home."

**Score 2:**
> "The employees who chose to work from home already wanted to. Forcing everyone to do it is different because they didn't choose it."

**Score 3:**
> "People who chose remote work self-selected because it suited them. Mandating it forces people who thrive on office interaction, new employees who need mentoring, or those without good home setups into an arrangement that doesn't fit them."

## Task 5: Professional

**Meta-cluster covers:** Law, Business, Medicine, Education

**What it measures:** Weighing competing interests, ethical reasoning under constraints, justifying judgment calls

**Format:** Short response

**Task:**

> A junior doctor is running behind schedule. The next patient has been waiting 45 minutes for a routine check-up. The current patient, an elderly woman, is medically fine but clearly lonely and wants to keep talking.
>
> What should the doctor do, and why?
>
> [Text box]

**AI grading criteria:**

| Score | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| 0 | Just picks an action with no reasoning |
| 1 | Picks an action with basic justification |
| 2 | Acknowledges the tension between competing duties |
| 3 | Weighs trade-offs, considers both patients' perspectives, shows awareness that both options have costs |

**Example answers by score:**

**Score 0:**
> "Move on to the next patient."

**Score 1:**
> "The doctor should politely end the conversation because other patients are waiting."

**Score 2:**
> "The doctor has a duty to the waiting patient but also to the current patient's wellbeing. They should explain they need to move on but perhaps offer to arrange a longer appointment or suggest support services."

**Score 3:**
> "Both patients have legitimate needs. The waiting patient deserves timely care, which is a medical duty. The elderly woman's loneliness is real but not something a running-behind doctor can solve in the moment. The doctor should be warm but clear, perhaps spend 30 more seconds acknowledging her before closing, and flag to the practice that she might benefit from social prescribing. Staying too long harms the next patient; leaving abruptly harms her."

## Task 6: Creative

**Meta-cluster covers:** Art, Design, Media, Architecture

**What it measures:** Design reasoning, trade-off thinking, defending choices, understanding constraints

**Format:** Short response (structured)

**Task:**

> You're designing a poster for a charity event. The client wants it to be:
>
> 1. Eye-catching
> 2. Include all event details
> 3. Feel welcoming and not overwhelming
>
> You can only fully achieve two. Which two do you prioritise, and what do you sacrifice?
>
> [Text box]

**AI grading criteria:**

| Score | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| 0 | Doesn't make a choice or ignores the constraint |
| 1 | Picks two, single basic reason |
| 2 | Picks two, gives reasoning for each choice |
| 3 | Picks two, gives strong reasoning for each AND explains what's lost by sacrificing the third |

**Example answers by score:**

**Score 0:**
> "I would try to do all three."

**Score 1:**
> "Eye-catching and welcoming, because those are most important for a charity."

**Score 2:**
> "Eye-catching because charity posters compete with everything else in public spaces. Welcoming because charities rely on trust and approachability."

**Score 3:**
> "Eye-catching and welcoming. Eye-catching because charity posters compete with everything else in public spaces. If nobody stops to look, nothing else matters. Welcoming because charities rely on trust and approachability, especially for new donors. Sacrificing full details means some people won't have everything they need upfront, but an overwhelming poster loses people before they even read it."
