## Part 1: Forced-Choice Questions (20 items)

### TRA_01 (Transfer)
> You're stuck on a problem. You could try applying an approach from a different subject, but it might not work and you'd lose time. Or you could look up the specific method.
> - A: Try the cross-subject approach first. Even if it fails, I might learn something.
> - B: Look up the right method. No point reinventing the wheel.

**a_indicates:** high_transfer
**b_indicates:** low_transfer

---

### TRA_02 (Transfer)
> You've just learned something new and it clicks. What happens next?
> - A: I start noticing how it connects to other things I already know.
> - B: I focus on practising it until I've properly locked it in.

**a_indicates:** high_transfer
**b_indicates:** low_transfer

---

### REC_01 (Receptivity)
> Your mock results are lower than expected. A teacher offers to go through your paper with you.
> - A: Take them up on it. Quicker than figuring it out alone.
> - B: Look through it myself first. I'll ask if I get stuck.

**a_indicates:** high_receptivity
**b_indicates:** low_receptivity

---

### REC_02 (Receptivity)
> You've finished a draft of your personal statement. A family member offers to read it and give honest feedback.
> - A: Let them read it. Another perspective might catch something I can't see.
> - B: Hold off. I'd rather get it to a place I'm happy with first.

**a_indicates:** high_receptivity
**b_indicates:** low_receptivity

---

### TOL_01 (Tolerance)
> You've been stuck on a problem for 20 minutes with no progress. You could keep going or move on and come back later.
> - A: Keep going. Sometimes it clicks right after the frustrating bit.
> - B: Move on. I'll come back with fresh eyes.

**a_indicates:** high_tolerance
**b_indicates:** low_tolerance

---

### TOL_02 (Tolerance)
> You're working through a difficult topic and it's not making sense. You could push through the chapter or switch to something easier and return tomorrow.
> - A: Push through. I don't like leaving things half-understood.
> - B: Switch for now. Forcing it rarely works for me.

**a_indicates:** high_tolerance
**b_indicates:** low_tolerance

---

### PRE_01 (Precision)
> You've finished an assignment due in 20 minutes and spot a small inconsistency near the end. Fixing it properly would take 15 minutes, leaving no time to check anything else.
> - A: Fix it. I'd rather submit with one thing done properly.
> - B: Leave it and check the rest. One small error probably matters less than something bigger I haven't spotted.

**a_indicates:** high_precision
**b_indicates:** low_precision

---

### PRE_02 (Precision)
> You're in an exam with 10 minutes left and 3 questions unanswered.

> - B: Attempt all three at surface level. Partial marks add up.

**a_indicates:** high_precision
**b_indicates:** low_precision

---

### CAL_01 (Calibration)
> You've just submitted a piece of coursework. A friend asks how you think you did.

> - B: I say I don't know. I've been wrong too many times.

**a_indicates:** high_calibration
**b_indicates:** low_calibration

---

### CAL_02 (Calibration)
> You're about to hand in a test. You can review your answers or leave early.
> - A: Review. Even if I feel good, I might catch something.
> - B: Leave. If I second-guess myself I'll probably change right answers to wrong ones.

**a_indicates:** low_calibration
**b_indicates:** high_calibration

---

### DEP_01 (Depth)
> You're choosing a research topic for your EPQ. You could go narrow and specific or broad and exploratory.

> - B: Go broad. I'll discover more connections and it's more interesting.

**a_indicates:** high_depth
**b_indicates:** low_depth

---

### DEP_02 (Depth)
> You're interested in a topic but the syllabus only covers the basics. You could explore further or move on to other subjects.
> - A: Go deeper. I want to properly understand it, not just pass the exam.
> - B: Move on. I'll come back to it after exams if I'm still curious.

**a_indicates:** high_depth
**b_indicates:** low_depth

---

### STR_01 (Structure)
> You're starting a new project with no set format. You could plan it out first or dive in and shape it as you go.
> - A: Plan first. I work better knowing where I'm heading.
> - B: Dive in. I'll figure out the structure once I see what I've got.

**a_indicates:** high_structure
**b_indicates:** low_structure

---

### STR_02 (Structure)
> Two teachers explain the same topic differently. One gives clear steps to follow, the other lets you work it out yourself.
> - A: I prefer clear steps. I can focus on learning rather than guessing what to do.
> - B: I prefer working it out. I remember it better when I find my own way.

**a_indicates:** high_structure
**b_indicates:** low_structure

---

### SOC_01 (Social)
> You're stuck on a problem the night before it's due.
> - A: Message someone to talk it through. Explaining it often unsticks me.
> - B: Keep working alone. I focus better without back-and-forth.

**a_indicates:** high_social
**b_indicates:** low_social

---

### SOC_02 (Social)
> You're revising for a big exam. A friend suggests a study group.
> - A: Join. I revise better when I can discuss and test each other.
> - B: Decline. I cover more ground on my own.

**a_indicates:** high_social
**b_indicates:** low_social

---

### CON_01 (Consistency)
> It's a free weekend with no deadlines. You could do some work ahead or take the time off.
> - A: Do some work. I like staying on top of things even when there's no pressure.
> - B: Take it off. I work best when there's a real deadline.

**a_indicates:** high_consistency
**b_indicates:** low_consistency

---

### CON_02 (Consistency)
> Your productivity varies a lot day to day. Someone suggests a fixed daily schedule.
> - A: Worth trying. I'd probably get more done overall.
> - B: Wouldn't suit me. I work in bursts and that's fine.

**a_indicates:** high_consistency
**b_indicates:** low_consistency

---

### RET_01 (Retrieval)
> You're revising a topic you covered last month. You could reread your notes or test yourself without looking.
> - A: Test myself. It's harder but I'll know what I've actually forgotten.
> - B: Reread first. I want to refresh my memory before testing.

**a_indicates:** high_retrieval
**b_indicates:** low_retrieval

---

### RET_02 (Retrieval)
> You've got a set of flashcards and a set of summary notes for the same topic.
> - A: Flashcards. Active recall works better for me.
> - B: Summary notes. I prefer seeing everything laid out together.

**a_indicates:** high_retrieval
**b_indicates:** low_retrieval

## Part 2: Mini-Sample Tasks (6 items)

### STEM_TECH_01 (STEM-Technical)

**Meta-cluster:** Computing, Engineering, Maths
**Format:** MCQ
**Time limit:** 90 seconds

**Stimulus:**
> A student builds an automatic plant watering system:
> - Moisture sensor checks soil every hour
> - If soil is dry, pump activates for 10 seconds
> - Pump draws water from tank
> - Tank has a float sensor that shows empty/not empty
> - If tank is empty, warning light turns on and pump won't activate
>
> Problem: The soil is dry, the tank is full, but the pump never activates. The warning light is off.

**Question:** Which component is most likely faulty?

**Options:**
- A) Moisture sensor
- B) Pump
- C) Float sensor
- D) Warning light

**Correct answer:** A

**Follow-up questions:**
1. How did you find that? (😫 Frustrating | 😐 Neutral | 😊 Enjoyed it)
2. Could you do tasks like this regularly? (Yes | Maybe | No)

---

### STEM_SCI_01 (STEM-Scientific)

**Meta-cluster:** Physical Sciences, Life Sciences
**Format:** MCQ
**Time limit:** 90 seconds

**Stimulus:**
> You're growing bacteria for a lab project. You've set up three identical petri dishes with the same bacteria and nutrients.
>
> After 48 hours, two dishes have normal growth. The third has almost no growth, but you notice a small patch of mould in the corner.

**Question:** What's your next step?

**Options:**
- A) Discard the third dish and report results from the two successful ones
- B) Repeat the entire experiment. Something went wrong.
- C) Investigate the mould. It might be producing something that kills bacteria.
- D) Report all three dishes and note the anomaly for the supervisor

**Correct answer:** C (D also acceptable)

### HUM_01 (Humanities)

**Meta-cluster:** History, Languages, Philosophy, English
**Format:** MCQ
**Time limit:** 90 seconds

**Stimulus:**
> A historian writes:
>
> "The factory workers of 1830s Manchester lived in appalling conditions. Contemporary accounts describe overcrowded housing, poor sanitation, and widespread disease. This proves that industrialisation was a disaster for the working class."

**Question:** A tutor asks: "What's the problem with this argument?"

**Options:**
- A) The sources might be biased. Reformers had reasons to exaggerate.
- B) "Appalling" is subjective. Conditions might have been normal for the time.
- C) It only describes Manchester. Other industrial cities might have been different.
- D) It doesn't compare to conditions before industrialisation. Workers might have been worse off in rural areas.

**Correct answer:** D

**Follow-up questions:**
1. How did you find that? (😫 Frustrating | 😐 Neutral | 😊 Enjoyed it)
2. Could you do tasks like this regularly? (Yes | Maybe | No)
